# catch-a-ball
This is a game project challenge from Unity Junior Programmer Pathway Unit 2 - Basic Gameplay. In this game the player will catch a random ball that spawn from above and if the ball hit the ground is game over.

What I'll do in this challenge is to make a program that:
- Spawn a random ball A random ball (of 3) is generated at a random x position above the screen
- When the user presses spacebar, a dog is spawned and runs to catch the ball
- If the dog collides with the ball, the ball is destroyed
- If the ball hits the ground, a “Game Over” debug message is displayed
- The dogs and balls are removed from the scene when they leave the screen
